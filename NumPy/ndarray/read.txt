ndarray ->

Array in Numpy is a table of elements (usually numbers), 
all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers. 
In Numpy, number of dimensions of the array is called rank of the array.
A tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension is 
known as shape of the array. An array class in Numpy is called as ndarray. 
Elements in Numpy arrays are accessed by using square brackets and can be 
initialized by using nested Python Lists.

example :- 

[[ 1, 2, 3],
      [ 4, 2, 5]]

Here, rank = 2 (as it is 2-dimensional or it has 2 axes)
First dimension(axis) length = 2, second dimension has length = 3
[
    1-> [1,2,3],
    2-> [1,2,3]
]
overall shape can be expressed as: (2, 3)
